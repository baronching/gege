    <p contenteditable="true">I hope this letter finds you in good health. I want to start by saying how truly sorry I am for the hurt and disappointment I have caused you. It has been weighing heavily on my heart, and I want to make amends.

        I deeply regret my actions and the pain they have brought into our friendship. I value and cherish the bond we've built over the years, and I'm devastated that I have jeopardized it. You deserve better from a friend, and I am committed to making things right.
        
        I want you to know that I take full responsibility for my mistakes. I was thoughtless and inconsiderate, and I understand how my actions may have made you feel. It was never my intention to hurt you, but that doesn't excuse what I've done.
        
        I want to assure you that I have taken this time to reflect on my actions, their consequences, and how they have affected you. I am committed to making changes in my behavior to ensure that I never repeat this mistake.
        
        Your friendship means the world to me, and I want to earn back your trust and forgiveness. I am ready to listen and learn from your perspective, to understand how I can make amends and support you in any way I can.
        
        I am willing to work through this together, to rebuild our friendship on a foundation of trust, respect, and mutual understanding. If you need time or space, I completely understand, but please know that I am here, eager to make things right when you're ready.
        
        I value our friendship too much to let it slip away because of my foolishness. Please accept my heartfelt apology, and let's take the necessary steps to heal and grow from this experience.
        
        I hope we can talk soon and find a way to move forward. Until then, please know that you are in my thoughts, and I am sincerely sorry for the pain I've caused.
        
        With the utmost sincerity and regret,
        </p>
